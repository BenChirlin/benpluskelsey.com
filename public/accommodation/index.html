<p>Sonoma, as famous as it is, is still quite small and quaint. There are not many major hotels so we suggest you book your accommodation as soon as possible. The area is quite popular year round but especially around this lovely Fall date we’ve chosen.</p>
<h3 id="hotels">Hotels</h3>
<p>We were unable to find or secure any hotel blocks due to the popularity of the venue. However we were able to find <a href="https://www.hotelplanner.com/Search/?locale=en_US&amp;City=The%20Depot%20Hotel%20Restaurant%20Sonoma%20241%201st%20St%20W%2C%20Sonoma%2C%20CA%2095476%2C%20USA&amp;Latitude=38.2966458&amp;Longitude=-122.4581722&amp;InDate=09/14/2019&amp;OutDate=09/15/2019&amp;gid=5044932&amp;NumRooms=1&amp;sc=TheKnot_Article&amp;kw=eventpage&amp;_hp=1312019225219#dir-bar">this link</a> which may provide a discount. Otherwise we suggest you look at the following for where to stay.</p>

<p>If, as is very likely, there is no space at the hotels above we recommend you check Petaluma, a half hour drive away, or other nearby towns for larger hotels.</p>
<h3 id="other-options">Other Options</h3>
<p>As one of the favorite vacation spots for those here in “disruption” obsessed Silicon Valley there are plenty of alternatives in Sonoma if the slim pickings of hotels run out. Namely we suggest looking at <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/">Airbnb</a> (this is how we found our place!), <a href="https://www.vrbo.com/">VRBO</a>, <a href="https://www.homeaway.com/">Homeaway</a>, or <a href="https://www.trustedhousesitters.com/refer/RAF87908/">TrustedHousesitters</a> (this is what we use to take care of our cats when we go out of town!).</p>
