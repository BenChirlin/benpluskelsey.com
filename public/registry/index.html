<p>We love gifts as much as the next couple but we don’t feel a sincere need for more objects in our daily lives. As such we hope that if you do wish to give us a gift you consider donation to our Happily Ever After fund, a quarter of which we’ll be donating to charity. We will have a guest book table at the reception where you leave any gifts or envelopes. You can also gift digitally here.</p>

<p>It is Jewish tradition to give gifts of money for a wedding. Traditionally this is given in increments of $18, the numerical representation of “chai”, or “life”, in Hebrew. However much you decide to give know 25% will go to our favorite charities and the rest towards the next big steps in our lives as we build a family and hopefully buy a home.</p>

<p>We’re both big fans of charity and believe it is our individual duty, as privileged children of blessed families, to give to those causes that need our assistance. Please find a list of some of our favorite charities below. We’ll be distributing a quarter of the gift fund to charities like the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.thearcsf.org/">The Arc SF</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.chp-sf.org/">Community Housing Partnership SF</a></li>
