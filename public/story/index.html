<p>We first met in the summer of 2015 in our Oakland, California. We hit it off, pretty quickly and decided to give our relationship a serious try. Since then, we’ve been building our relationship and falling deeper in love everyday. Now we’re ready to start our next important chapter and hope you can join us in celebrating this exciting milestone.</p>
<h3 id="how-we-met">How We Met</h3>
<p>It was a summer night in Oakland. Our mutual friends Jess and Seamus were throwing a party at their home near Temescal. We began chatting above the party hubbub, eventually trading increasingly bad jokes back and forth. Ben, as always, had brought some little games to play with guests. After a few rounds of play he “made his move” and gave Kelsey a business card cause he’s classy like that. Several lovely dates followed thereafter.</p>
<h3 id="our-home">Our Home</h3>
<p>After dating for over a year across the Bay Bridge we decided it was time to move in together. Craigslist to the rescue! Following a thorough Oakland-based search (color-coded spreadsheet custom scoring index included) we lucked into a marvelous apartment in downtown Oakland steps away from the gorgeous Lake Merritt. We set up our home surrounded by the things we love including plentiful art, music, and games and have been living there quite happily with our two cats, Ame and Taiyo, ever since.</p>
<h3 id="what-s-next-">What&#39;s Next?</h3>
<p>We’re about to find out! And we hope you’ll be there with us along the way. We hope to stay in the Bay Area for the foreseeable future as we start this exciting next step in our relationship. But after that who knows!?</p>
