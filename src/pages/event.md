### Where

![Hotel Depot Restaurant](/images/depot-hotel-restaurant.jpg "Hotel Depot Restaurant")

We scoured the Bay Area for suitable wedding venues, everywhere from our Oakland backyard to the distant Redwoods. But when we visited the [Hotel Depot in Sonoma](http://www.depotsonoma.com/) it was a welcome reprieve from this otherwise stressful endeavor. The location, staff, food, and (most importantly) the venue itself were all superb. We hope you will agree! The address is:
