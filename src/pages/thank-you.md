## Thank You

We thank everyone who attended and who also contributed to our Happliy Ever After fund. We've already begun improving our kitchen with a new Pizza Steel and booked a honeymoon to Belize! We're excited to purchase a new tent and spend some nights under the stars and will be sure to share when we do.

### Charity

We were able to contribute around 10% of our funds to the following nonprofits we both care deeply about:

- [The Arc SF](https://www.thearcsf.org/)
- [The Sierra Club: SF Bay Area](https://www.sierraclub.org/san-francisco-bay)
- [The Malala Fund](https://www.malala.org/)
