## Accommodation

Sonoma, as famous as it is, is still quite small and quaint. There are not many major hotels so we suggest you book your accommodation as soon as possible. The area is quite popular year round but especially around this lovely Fall date we've chosen.

### Hotels

We were unable to find or secure any hotel blocks due to the popularity of the venue. We suggest primarily looking at [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/) (this is how we found our place!), [VRBO](https://www.vrbo.com/), [Homeaway](https://www.homeaway.com/), or [TrustedHousesitters](https://www.trustedhousesitters.com/refer/RAF87908/) (this is what we use to take care of our cats when we go out of town!).

We *were* able to find [this link](https://www.hotelplanner.com/Search/?locale=en_US&City=The%20Depot%20Hotel%20Restaurant%20Sonoma%20241%201st%20St%20W%2C%20Sonoma%2C%20CA%2095476%2C%20USA&Latitude=38.2966458&Longitude=-122.4581722&InDate=09/14/2019&OutDate=09/15/2019&gid=5044932&NumRooms=1&sc=TheKnot_Article&kw=eventpage&_hp=1312019225219#dir-bar) to possible discounts for accommodations if available. While the following hotels may be booked, we thought we'd list these as places you might like to check:

- [The Sonoma Hotel](https://www.sonomahotel.com/) quaint and historic
- [The Lodge Marriott](https://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/sfols-the-lodge-at-sonoma-renaissance-resort-and-spa/?scid=bb1a189a-fec3-4d19-a255-54ba596febe2) resort and spa
- [El Pueblo Inn](http://www.elpuebloinn.com/) a wine country oasis
- [Swiss Hotel](http://www.swisshotelsonoma.com/) small and downtown
- [MacArthur Place](https://www.macarthurplace.com/) high end

If, as noted, there is no space at the hotels above, we recommend you check Petaluma, a half-hour drive away, or other nearby towns for larger hotels.
