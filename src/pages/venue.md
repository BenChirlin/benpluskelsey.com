## Sonoma

We're excited for you to join us in lovely, sunny, Sonoma! If you've never been you're in for a treat. In fact we recommend you give yourself an extra day or two so you can enjoy more of the Sonoma/Marin County area or even the entirety of the Bay. It is a popular time of year for the region so make sure you make your plans early.

### Hotel Depot Restaurant

We scoured the Bay Area for suitable wedding venues, everywhere from our Oakland backyard to the distant Redwoods. But when we visited the Hotel Depot in Sonoma it was a welcome reprieve from this otherwise stressful endeavor. The location, staff, food, and (most importantly) the venue itself were all superb. We hope you will agree!

### Where to Eat

Sonoma and the surrounding area are home to many fantastic restaurants. For breakfast we particularly enjoy Sunflower Caffé. If you want something a bit more quick and casual we recommend the Basque Boulangerie Café. For any meal The Girl & The Fig is a renowned place to go. Meanwhile Hopmonk is a great spot for food and drinks later on in the night.

Outside of downtown Sonoma, nearby Petaluma has some fantastic spots. You can grab a fantastic breakfast at the Tea Room Cafe or Sax's Joint. Or swing by the Lagunita's awesome taproom.

### What to Do

We would be remiss not to mention Sonoma's amazing wineries! In fact there are too many to name. Some of our favorites include Jacuzzi and Cline Vineyards just a short drive out of downtown. The oil and vinegar tastings available at Jacuzzi are particularly lovely while the rosé at Cline is one our must-trys. You could also consider visiting Domaine Carneros for some classy European architecture and amazing champagnes to match. If you're looking for a more guided tour of the many fantastic vineyards check out the Wine Train or many available tours.

There are also plenty of lovely cheese producers in the area. Marin French Cheese and Nicasio Valley Cheese are two great ones to get you started. You can even check out the amazing California Cheese Trail! And if our engagement photos got you excited we recommend travelling west to Hog Island Oyster Company. Though if that's too far you can also visit their location in Napa's Oxbow Public Market.

Lastly we'd recommend you take some time to enjoy the lovely bounties of nature in the area. Point Reyes is a fantastic spot to view the lovely California coast line or go on a short hike. Muir Woods, just a bit further south, is another world famous spot. You can also consider travelling north to Lake Berryessa for a look at the impressive dam with it's famous drain hole you can occasionally see flowing depending on the weather.

### How to Get There

Sonoma is most easily travelled with a vehicle. As such we recommend you rent a vehicle if you plan on travelling around and seeing sites. However Lyft is available in the area and we'll providing a credit on the platform so please consider using that to at least get home after the wedding as we want you all to be safe. If you're just coming to town for the celebrations and are staying in or near Sonoma you'll probably be fine without a dedicated vehicle, just relying on ridesharing services.
