## Registry

At this time in our lives, having been together for four years and combining two households, we don't feel a sincere need for many more objects in our lives. As such we have decided to set up a registry with a *Happily Ever After* and a few dream items you can contribute towards. This fund will help us take the next big steps in our lives as we go on a tropical honeymoon, build a family, and hopefully buy a home. We also intend to donate a percentage of our gifts to several charities.

There will be a guest book table at the reception where gifts or envelopes may be left. You can also gift digitally [here](https://registry.theknot.com/kelsey-hermann-ben-chirlin-september-2019-ca/33871414).

### Charity

We both believe it is our individual duty, as privileged children of blessed families, to give to those causes that need our assistance. We'll be distributing a percentage of our *Happily Ever After* fund to the following:

- [The Arc SF](https://www.thearcsf.org/)
- [Community Housing Partnership SF](https://www.chp-sf.org/)
- [The Malala Fund](https://www.malala.org/)
