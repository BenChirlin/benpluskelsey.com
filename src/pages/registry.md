## Registry

We love gifts as much as the next couple but we don’t feel a sincere need for more objects in our daily lives. As such we hope that if you do wish to give us a gift you consider donation to our Happily Ever After fund, a quarter of which we’ll be donating to charity. We will have a guest book table at the reception where you leave any gifts or envelopes. You can also gift digitally here.

### Happily Ever After

It is Jewish tradition to give gifts of money for a wedding. Traditionally this is given in increments of $18, the numerical representation of “chai”, or “life”, in Hebrew. However much you decide to give know 25% will go to our favorite charities and the rest towards the next big steps in our lives as we build a family and hopefully buy a home.

### Charities

We’re both big fans of charity and believe it is our individual duty, as privileged children of blessed families, to give to those causes that need our assistance. Please find a list of some of our favorite charities below. We’ll be distributing a quarter of the gift fund to charities like the following:

- [The Arc SF](https://www.thearcsf.org/)
- [Community Housing Partnership SF](https://www.chp-sf.org/)
- [The Malala Fund](https://www.malala.org/)
