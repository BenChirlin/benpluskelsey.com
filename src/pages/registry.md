## Registry

At this time in our lives, having been together for four years and combining two households, we hope that in lieu of a gift item, you will consider a contribution to our Happily Ever After Fund, a quarter of which we intend to donate to charity. The Fund will help us take the next big steps in our lives as we build a family and hopefully buy a home.

There will be a guest book table at the reception where gifts or envelopes may be left.

### Happily Ever After

It is Jewish tradition to give gifts of money for a wedding. Traditionally this is given in increments of $18, the numerical representation of "chai", or "life", in Hebrew. However much you decide to give know 25% will go to our favorite charities and the rest towards the next big steps in our lives as we build a family and hopefully buy a home.

### Charities

We both believe it is our individual duty, as privileged children of blessed families, to give to those causes that need our assistance. We'll be distributing a quarter of the gift fund to the following:

- [The Arc SF](https://www.thearcsf.org/)
- [Community Housing Partnership SF](https://www.chp-sf.org/)
- [The Malala Fund](https://www.malala.org/)
- Final list TBD
