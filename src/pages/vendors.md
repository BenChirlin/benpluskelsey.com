Thank you [Lori McQuiddy (aka Floralei's)](http://www.floraleis.com) for the gorgeous, local, and in season flowers that made our event such a beautiful, and nice smelling, occasion. We've dried the many herbs provided and will be cooking with them for months to come, each taste reminding of us of that lovely September night.

## Music

Thank you [Pat Hugunin](https://www.hugentertainment.com/) for your excellent work DJing. Sorting through our multiple playlists of songs which would've lasted many party's worth of dancing was no small task. Your MC work was on point as well!
